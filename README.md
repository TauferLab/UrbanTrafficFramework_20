# UrbanTrafficFramework_20

## Abstract
We present a methodology to perform an analysis of traffic flows and the resultant vehicle exhaust emissions.
We design and implement an analysis and visualization framework that includes metrics and algorithms for adjusting, transforming, relating, and visualizing data, as well as statistical methods for quantifying correlations.
Our ﬁndings from applying this framework to the Chicago Loop reveal the relationships between traﬃc congestion, building distributions, and vehicle emissions.
These insights can provide communities with decision-making tools for urban design and smart cities.

## Methodology
Our methodology includes four steps: preparation and validation of the data, mapping vehicles to buildings, mapping emissions to spatial cells, and correlation analysis between vehicle and emissions.
